description: >
  threebody function simulates the three-body problem using numerical integration.
  It generates a GIF animation of the simulation.

examples:
  'gif = threebody(
      mass1=10000, mass2=300, mass3=100,
      pos1=(0, 0), pos2=(100, 0), pos3=(50, np.sqrt(3)/2*100),
      vel1=(0.1, 0.1), vel2=(0, np.sqrt(3)/2*2), vel3=(-np.sqrt(3)/2*2, 0),
      total_time=500, time_step=1.0)'

    description: Total simulation time in seconds.
  - name: time_step
    type: float
    required: true
    description: Time step for the simulation in seconds. If this is smaller than total_time/100 ask the user's permission for a long generation.

returns:
